# QuantumTwistingMicroscope (QTM)

Working repository for simulating a **Quantum Twisting Microscope (QTM)** using the Python package [sisl](https://github.com/zerothi/sisl).

---

## 📂 Project Structure
- `QTM/` → main project folder (contains source code and the virtual environment).
- `requirements.txt` → list of dependencies.

---

## ⚙️ Setup Environment

It is recommended to use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for managing the environment.

```bash
cd QTM
uv sync
```
## 💻 Windows Users

Since sisl does not currently provide a Windows wheel:

- It is recommended to work inside WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
- Alternatively, conda might also work, but this has not been tested.

## 🚀 Usage

(coming soon — add instructions here on how to run simulations, scripts, or notebooks once ready)
